CloudLaunch – AltSchool Cloud Engineering Project

This project, called CloudLaunch, was completed as part of my AltSchool Africa Cloud Engineering assignment. It demonstrates my understanding of core AWS services such as S3, IAM, CloudFront, and VPC networking. The work is divided into two main parts:

Hosting a static website using Amazon S3 and controlling access with IAM.

Designing and configuring a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) with subnets, route tables, and security groups.

All work was done within my AWS Free Tier account.

Task 1 – Static Website Hosting with S3 and IAM
Buckets I Created

cloudlaunch-site-bucket-pharaoh

Purpose: Hosts my public static website.

Configuration: Static website hosting enabled with my index.html uploaded.

Permissions: Bucket is private; public access blocked. Only CloudFront Origin Access Identity (OAI) can read the files.

cloudlaunch-private-bucket-pharaoh

Purpose: Stores private files for internal use.

Configuration: Public access blocked.

Permissions: Only the IAM user I created can access the files.

cloudlaunch-visible-only-bucket-pharaoh

Purpose: Demonstrates a bucket that the IAM user can see exists but cannot read or download objects.

Website

I uploaded a simple HTML file to the site bucket with the following content:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>CloudLaunch</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Hello, Welcome to CloudLaunch</h1>
  <p>This is a test static site hosted on Amazon S3.</p>
  <p>By Oladoye Toyeeb Olaoluwa</p>
</body>
</html>


CloudFront URL (public, secure):

https://d1o71ngf6t1y6t.cloudfront.net


S3 URL(Unsecure): http://cloudlaunch-bucket-site-pharaoh.s3-website-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com

CloudFront Setup

To make my website globally accessible and secure, I configured a CloudFront distribution:

Origin Settings:

Origin Domain: cloudlaunch-site-bucket-pharaoh

Restrict Bucket Access: Yes

I Created a new Origin Access Identity (OAI) → cloudlaunch-oai

Granted CloudFront read access to the bucket.

Cache Behavior:

Viewer Protocol Policy: Redirect HTTP to HTTPS

Allowed HTTP Methods: GET, HEAD

Supported HTTP Versions: HTTP/2 enabled, HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/1.0 supported

Distribution Settings:

Price Class: North America & Europe (Free Tier friendly)

Default Root Object: index.html

WAF: Disabled

I Created the distribution and waited for it to be deployed.

IAM User and Policy

User: cloudlaunch-user-pharaoh

Policy Name: CloudLaunchS3VpcPolicypharaoh

Console Login: Enabled with an autogenerated password (user must reset on first login).

Permissions I configured:

Can ListBucket on all three buckets.

Can GetObject/PutObject on cloudlaunch-private-bucket-pharaoh.

Can only GetObject from cloudlaunch-site-bucket-pharaoh.

Cannot access objects in cloudlaunch-visible-only-bucket-pharaoh.

Cannot delete any objects.

Can ec2:DescribeVpcs for read-only visibility of VPC resources.

IAM Policy JSON:

(JSON remains the same as before)

Task 2 – VPC Design
VPC

Name: cloudlaunch-vpc

CIDR Block: 10.0.0.0/16

Purpose: Provides a secure network foundation for my application.

Subnets
Name	CIDR Block	Type	Purpose
cloudlaunch-public-subnet	10.0.1.0/24	Public	For load balancers or public-facing resources
cloudlaunch-app-subnet	10.0.2.0/24	Private	For application servers processing logic
cloudlaunch-db-subnet	10.0.3.0/28	Private	For databases, fully isolated from the internet
Route Tables

cloudlaunch-public-rt: Routes 0.0.0.0/0 to Internet Gateway; associated with public subnet.

cloudlaunch-app-rt: Private; associated with app subnet; no internet access.

cloudlaunch-db-rt: Private; associated with DB subnet; no internet access.

Internet Gateway

Name: cloudlaunch-igw

Attached to: cloudlaunch-vpc

Purpose: Provides internet access only for the public subnet.

Security Groups

cloudlaunch-app-sg: Allows inbound HTTP (80) only from within the VPC.

cloudlaunch-db-sg: Allows inbound MySQL (3306) only from the app subnet.

Conclusion

This project shows my ability to:

Host a secure static site on S3 using CloudFront and OAI.

Manage different bucket access levels with IAM policies.

Design a VPC with proper subnets, routing, and security groups.

Deploy a global, HTTPS-enabled site with caching using CloudFront.

Through this assignment, I demonstrated my understanding of AWS core services and best practices while staying within Free Tier limits.

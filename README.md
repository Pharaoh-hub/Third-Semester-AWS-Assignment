CloudLaunch – AltSchool Cloud Engineering Project

This project, called CloudLaunch, was completed as part of my AltSchool Africa Cloud Engineering Third Semester Assignment. It demonstrates my understanding of core AWS services, including S3, IAM, CloudFront, and VPC networking. The work is divided into two main parts:

Hosting a static website using Amazon S3 and controlling access with IAM.

Designing and configuring a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) with subnets, route tables, and security groups.

All work was completed within my AWS Free Tier account.

Task 1 – Static Website Hosting with S3 and IAM
Buckets Created

1. cloudlaunch-site-bucket-pharaoh

Purpose: Hosts my public static website.

Configuration: Static website hosting enabled with index.html uploaded.

Permissions: Bucket is private; public access blocked. Only CloudFront Origin Access Identity (OAI) can read files.

2. cloudlaunch-private-bucket-pharaoh

Purpose: Stores private files for internal use.

Configuration: Public access blocked.

Permissions: Accessible only by the IAM user I created.

3. cloudlaunch-visible-only-bucket-pharaoh

Purpose: Demonstrates a bucket that the IAM user can see exists but cannot read or download objects.

CloudFront Setup

Origin Domain: cloudlaunch-site-bucket-pharaoh

Restrict Bucket Access: Yes

Origin Access Identity (OAI): cloudlaunch-oai

Cache Behavior:

Viewer Protocol Policy: Redirect HTTP → HTTPS

Allowed HTTP Methods: GET, HEAD

Supported HTTP Versions: HTTP/2, HTTP/1.1, HTTP/1.0

Distribution Settings:

Price Class: North America & Europe (Free Tier friendly)

Default Root Object: index.html

IAM User and Policy

User: cloudlaunch-user-pharaoh
Policy Name: CloudLaunchS3VpcPolicypharaoh
Console Login: Enabled with an autogenerated password, user must reset on first login.

Permissions Configured:

Can ListAllMyBuckets (so the instructor can see all buckets in the console).

Can ListBucket on all three buckets.

Can GetObject from site bucket.

Can GetObject/PutObject from private bucket.

Cannot access objects in visible-only bucket.

Cannot delete any objects.

Can ec2:DescribeVpcs, DescribeSubnets, DescribeRouteTables, DescribeSecurityGroups, DescribeInternetGateways, DescribeNetworkAcls, DescribeAddresses for read-only visibility of VPC resources.

}

Task 2 – VPC Design
VPC

Name: cloudlaunch-vpc

CIDR Block: 10.0.0.0/16

Purpose: Provides a secure network foundation for my application.

Subnets
Name	CIDR Block	Type	Purpose
cloudlaunch-public-subnet	10.0.1.0/24	Public	For load balancers or public-facing resources
cloudlaunch-app-subnet	10.0.2.0/24	Private	For application servers processing logic
cloudlaunch-db-subnet	10.0.3.0/28	Private	For databases, fully isolated from the internet
Route Tables

cloudlaunch-public-rt: Routes 0.0.0.0/0 → Internet Gateway; associated with public subnet.

cloudlaunch-app-rt: Private; associated with app subnet; no internet access.

cloudlaunch-db-rt: Private; associated with DB subnet; no internet access.

Internet Gateway

Name: cloudlaunch-igw

Attached to: cloudlaunch-vpc

Purpose: Provides internet access only for the public subnet.

Security Groups

cloudlaunch-app-sg: Allows inbound HTTP (80) only from within the VPC.

cloudlaunch-db-sg: Allows inbound MySQL (3306) only from the app subnet.

Conclusion

This project demonstrates my ability to:

Host a secure static site on S3 using CloudFront and OAI.

Manage different bucket access levels with IAM policies, including console visibility for instructors.

Design a VPC with proper subnets, routing, and security groups.

Deploy a global, HTTPS-enabled site with caching using CloudFront.

All steps were performed while staying within AWS Free Tier limits and following AWS best practices.
